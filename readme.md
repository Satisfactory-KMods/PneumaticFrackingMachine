For oil nodes (not wells)! This beast pumps air deep into an oil nodes to force more of the black goo out! Mk1 has 2 outputs at 100% node capacity (200% oil), Mk3 has 4 outputs (400%), and Mk3 has 6 outputs (600%) - AND you can overclock it (A little). But wait, there's more! You don't get anything for free, sorry not sorrry! The oil comes out filled with gassy bubbles, so you'll have to run it through a refinery to get those out. We've added a an Alternate recipe so you can de-gas the oil faster, too.

This is a collaborative project by:

**Kyrium** - Code <br />
**Deantendo** - Concept, direction, Icon <br />

We feel that the mod is reasonably balanced, but please do give us feedback if you think it needs changing in some way.

- MK1 - 2 outputs at 100% of node purity
- MK2 - 4 outputs at 100% of node purity
- MK3 - 6 outputs at 100% of node purity
- 2 New Recipes to make it back to Oil!
- All can Unlock in T6 (one by one)

KMods use an API (https://kmods.de/api) to show Patreons. This will always happen in the background except you prevent it. For what will offer a one-time pop-up in the main menu (one time) and can change every time in the mod configuration from KPrivateCodeLib!
